==================

Using New Relic and Heroku see how many things you can find and fix to make this app perform fast!

Step 1
-------
Get the code. The code is waiting to be forked on [github](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-python-kata)

Step 2
-------
Create a virtualenv and install the dependencies.

     cd newrelic-python-kata
     python virtualenv.py venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3
-------
Install Newrelic agent.

     pip install newrelic     
     newrelic-admin generate-config <license-key> newrelic.ini

Open the newrelic.ini file for editing.
Set the "transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold" to 0.2

Set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable.

     export NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini

Step 4
------
Start the app.

     newrelic-admin run-python manage.py run_gunicorn

Step 5
-------
Fix the code / Solve as many of the Katas as you can.

1. Access the application http://localhost:8000
2. Generate traffic a.k.a. click around.
3. Discover a slow page.
4. Investigate the problem.
5. Resolve with code changes.
6. Restart application.

     Repeat...

Step 6
